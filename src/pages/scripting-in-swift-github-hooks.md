This week I decided to tick one of my to-do items which I have been putting off for a while at work to improve my git workflow. 

To give our commits as much context as possible, we tend to include the `JIRA` issue number for the feature we are working on in the commit message. This way, if in the future someone goes back to the piece of work we're committing and does a `git blame` they'll be able to find the ticket without having to do any more digging.

Including this information for every commit can be somewhat tedious and, despite the fact that git clients such as [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac) make this a bit easier, you still need to manually copy-paste the issue number into the commit message manually and remember to do so, which is what I struggle with the most ðŸ˜….

For this reason, I set out on a quest to learn about git hooks in an attempt to automate this task. My idea was to be able to get the JIRA ticket from the git branch (we usually have a set branch naming convention `story/ISSUE-1234_branch-name`) and then alter the commit message to prefix it with the ticket number, making the end result message: `ISSUE-1234 - Some awesome commit message`.

## Automating commit messages with git hooks
[Git Hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) provide a way of triggering custom actions when certain important git commands are run, such as running actions before a commit or push occur. 

In this case, I made use of the `commit-msg` hook, which provides you with a way of altering the current commit message before it is applied. The hook gets invoked with a single argument, which is the path to the file containing the commit message entered by the user. This means that, in order to alter the commit message, we simply need to read from the file, modify the string and then write back to the file the hook was invoked with.

To create a git hook, we need to provide an executable script with the name of the hook under `.git/hooks`. So, in my case, my hook could be found at the following path: `.git/hooks/commit-msg`.

## Why did I use Swift?
Git hooks can be written in any language you would usually use to script with and that its interpreter, specified through a shebang, is installed in the host computer. 

While there is a wide range of more popular options such as bash or ruby, I decided to go for Swift as I am a lot more comfortable with it since I use it on a daily basis and really enjoy its strongly typed syntax and low memory footprint.

### Getting set up
You can write a Swift script with any IDE you like but, if you want to get proper autocomplete and debugging capabilities, you can create an Xcode project for it. To do so, create a new project and, under `macos`, choose `Command Line Tool`.

![Creating a new command line application project from Xcode](/assets/posts/scripting-with-swift-github-hooks/xcode-new-project.png)

At the top of the created file, add the swift shebang:
```swift:main.swift
#!/usr/bin/swift
import Foundation
```

This is necessary so that when git executes the file, the shebang will make sure that the `/bin/swift` binary is invoked with the file as its input data.

### Writing the git hook
The project is all set up, so the git hook can now be written.

#### Retrieving the commit message
The first thing to do is to retrieve the path to the temporary commit file from the script's arguments and read its contents:

```swift:main.swift
let commitMessageFile = CommandLine.arguments[1]

guard let data = FileManager.default.contents(atPath: commitMessageFile),
      let commitMessage = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) else {
	  print("Could not read commit message file")
    exit(1)
}
```

In the snippet above, we firstly get the path to the commit message file (passed in to the script by git) and reading its contents using the `FileManager` API. If for some reason we fail to retrieve this, we `exit` the script with a status of 1, which will tell git to abort the commit.

> Note that, according to the [git hooks documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks), if any of the hook scripts exits with a  code other than `0`, it will abort the action that is about to take place. This will be used later on in the article to exit gracefully when no modifications need to be applied.

#### Retrieving the ticket number
Now that the commit message string is available, it is time to find out what the current branch is and retrieve the ticket number from it. As mentioned earlier in this article, this hook is only possible because of the team's strict format on branch naming, which always contains the JIRA ticket in its name (e.g. `story/ISSUE-1234_some-awesome-feature-work`).

To achieve this, we must retrieve the current working branch and then apply a [Regular Expression](https://nshipster.com/swift-regular-expressions/) to retrieve the ticket number from it.

Let's start by adding the ability for our script to invoke a command from the `zsh` shell by making use of the `Process` api, which will allow our script to interact with the `git` command line interface.

```swift:main.swift
func shell(_ command: String) -> String {
    let task = Process()
    let pipe = Pipe()
    
    task.standardOutput = pipe
    task.standardError = pipe
    task.arguments = ["-c", command]
    task.launchPath = "/bin/zsh"
    task.launch()
    
    let data = pipe.fileHandleForReading.readDataToEndOfFile()
    let output = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)!
    
    return output
}
``` 

Now that the `shell` command is implemented, it can then be used to ask `git` what the current branch is and then extracting the ticket name from it if possible:

```swift:main.swift
let gitBranchName = shell("git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD")
    .trimmingCharacters(in: .newlines)

let regex = try! NSRegularExpression(pattern: #"(\w*-\d*)"#, options: .anchorsMatchLines)
let stringRange = NSRange(location: 0, length: gitBranchName.utf16.count)

guard let match = regex.firstMatch(in: gitBranchName, range: stringRange) else { exit(0) }

let range = match.range(at: 1)

let ticketNumber = (gitBranchName as NSString)
    .substring(with: range)
    .trimmingCharacters(in: .newlines)
```   

Note how if there is no match (i.e. if the branch does not contain a JIRA issue in its name) the script exits mercifully with a status of 0, allowing the commit to go ahead. This is to not break the workflow in branches such as `main` or other test/investigation ones.

#### Altering the commit message
In order to alter the commit message, the contents of the file that was read at the beginning of the script (containing the commit message) must be altered and written back to that same path.

In this case, there is only one alteration that needs doing, which is prefixing the commit message with the JIRA ticket number and a (-) to separate it nicely from the rest of the commit. It is also important to make sure that the commit message string is checked and the ticket number is only added if it's not already there:

```swift:main.swift
if !commitMessage.contains(ticketNumber) {
    do {
        try "\(ticketNumber) - \(commitMessage.trimmingCharacters(in: .newlines))"
            .write(toFile: commitMessageFile, atomically: true, encoding: .utf8)
    } catch {
        print("Could not write to file \(commitMessageFile)")
        exit(1)
    }
}
```

#### Setting up the git hook
Now that the script is ready, it is time to tell it where it should. Git hooks can be set up globally or on a per-repo basis. 

My personal preference for these kind of scripts is to set them up on a per-repo basis, as that gives you more control and visibility in case something goes wrong and, should the hook start to fail, it would fail for the repos where it's added and not globally.

To set them up, we simply need to make the file executable and then rename it and copy it to the `.git/hooks/` directory for the desired repo:

```bash:Terminal
chmod +x main.swift
mv main.swift <path_to_your_repo>/.git/hooks/commit-msg
```

## Testing the result
Now that the repo is all set up, all that needs doing is putting the script to the test. In the screenshot below, two branches are created, one with a ticket number in its name and one without and the same commit is applied to both. It can be seen that the script is working correctly and the commit message is being altered only when needed!
